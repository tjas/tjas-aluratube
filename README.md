This project is an adaptation and evolution of the **[AluraTube](https://github.com/alura-challenges/aluratube)** project, proposed at [Alura](https://www.alura.com.br/)'s 5th React Immersion, that occured in november 2022. It initially intended to spread basic knowledgements about [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) technology, but became an opportunity do practice and evolve personal skills in such technology and other related ones.

The **React** is a [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) library created by Facebook for building modern user interfaces, known as front-end applications, which are connected to back-end applications, that serves content and manage negocial rules in complex systems. The React runs over the [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/), an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment, and is potencialyzed by other libraries and frameworks, mainly the [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/), a very popular framework, wich is even used in this project.

The TJAS AluraTube is a video platform inspired by [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/). However, the **TJAS AluraTube** does not intend to be an YouTube's copy, but even go beyond: taking the project developed at React Immersion as starting point, but proposing some innovative features that just refer to YouTube as the main videos and contents provider.
